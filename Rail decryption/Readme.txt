This program will need the format from Myfile.txt as it finds the '=' in order, just use same textfiles. 
Also Filepath will need to be changed to your filepath to text files.

Rail program.
This program will read and write to both console and a file. I uses rail decryption to encrypt text and decrypt.
The key is used to determine the height of the rail encryption and the 2nd key on a second level encryption
will determine how far back up it will go before resetting e.g. 
word: puppetMaster
key a: 4
key b: 2
